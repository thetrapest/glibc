/* Use a single double-word shift instead of two shifts and an ior.
   If the uses of MERGE were close to the computation of shl/shr,
   the compiler might have been able to create this itself.
   But instead that computation is well separated.

   Using an inline function instead of a macro is the easiest way
   to ensure that the types are correct.  */
